# Requirements
The programs listed below are required to run this app correctly.

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com)
- [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
- [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

# Tips
- If you want to preview a github repository project, use a shorthand by providing only a github and repo name. eg. `react-instant Misieq01/notemaster`

# Caveats
- The provided project's `package.json` has to contain a `build` command (like the one generated by create-react-app). You can change the script name by using `buildScript` flag.
- When using `envPath` flag, make sure to name your selected file `.env`, otherwise it will not be copied correctly. (See [#10](https://github.com/DRFR0ST/react-instant/issues/10))
